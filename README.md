# Prototype Problem Statement
Environment Education
Design a hack or tool that you would use to educate a family member about climatic change
# Protoype Summary
Our idea is to create an application to educate family members about climate changes. We think that speaking about what has happened, it is always important to speak about what to do. We feel planting trees is the solution for this. Thus we named our application as GROW BUDS.
Initially, the user registers by providing their basic login details. If the user has already registered, they can login to the application by providing their phone number and password.
We have six different features that would  keep them engaged and helps them to learn more about the climate changes. The news column, gives the current and updated news about climate changes.
Coming to the events column, the user gets to know about the upcoming , ongoing and the events that has been already over. 
Seminar column  in turn helps them get to know about the threats caused due to global warming and various other factors.
Coming to the quiz column, it keeps the user engaged as he can play across while learning.
Gardening is one such beautiful hobby through which kids learn their responsibilities and also to remain patient. This feed me column gives  such tips for kids to plant trees and grow them faster and healthier .
The facts column gives the interesting and exiting info about climatic changes.
We also encourage our users to buy plants by clicking on the button present at the bottom.
“Grow plants, leave this wonderful world as such for our future generations”
Thankyou!
